<time>22 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>March 27&nbsp;is the magic date for The 94th <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Academy Awards</a>, but way before that, <a href=# title=movie data-link=tag>movie</a> critics had already created their lists of&nbsp;nominees. Of&nbsp;course, all <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> stars dream of&nbsp;winning an&nbsp;Oscar. There are those “lucky” actors who get nominated almost every year, but only the special chosen ones end up&nbsp;being the winner. We&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;find out why life and the Academy of&nbsp;Motion Picture Arts and Sciences are so&nbsp;unfair to&nbsp;them.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> decided to&nbsp;find the answer to&nbsp;this question. We&nbsp;believe that there are a&nbsp;few valid reasons why some actors haven’t won an&nbsp;Oscar yet. Below, you can find some of&nbsp;our observations and assumptions.</p><p>For example, some actors are still Oscar-less because they stay within a&nbsp;certain line of&nbsp;roles, some prefer to&nbsp;stay away from events that could give them points, like at&nbsp;the ceremony following the event, and some just aren’t lucky enough.</p><p>We&nbsp;put together 15&nbsp;talented actors and actresses who have been nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar at&nbsp;least once but haven’t won this award yet.</p><p><h2>1. Amy Adams</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/96a/ef4/8c59fe588e8dacc1aca654f084.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Amy Adams</a> has been nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar 6&nbsp;times for movies like <i>Doubt, The Master, </i>and <i>American Hustle</i>. In&nbsp;2016, she was excellent in&nbsp;her part as&nbsp;Louise Banks in&nbsp;the sci-fi flick, <i>Arrival.</i> And she wasn’t even nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar for this part, which made her fans furious.</p><p>Perhaps the reason why Adams still hasn’t won this trophy is&nbsp;that she started her <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> in&nbsp;Hollywood rather late&nbsp;— she was already 25&nbsp;years old at&nbsp;the time she began in&nbsp;the industry. By&nbsp;this age, many stars have been nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar a&nbsp;few times since it’s pretty normal to&nbsp;start an&nbsp;acting career at&nbsp;an&nbsp;early age. But Adams still has a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time ahead of&nbsp;her.</p><p><h2>2. Bradley Cooper</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c40/e5c/5ea1d65b6ea31f694f8e6780b7.jpg><p><a href=# title="Bradley Cooper" data-link=tag>Bradley Cooper</a> was nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar 3&nbsp;years in&nbsp;a&nbsp;row. The first time took place in&nbsp;2013 when he&nbsp;was nominated for Best Actor for his leading role in&nbsp;<i>Silver Linings Playbook</i>, but the statuette went to&nbsp;Daniel Day-Lewis for <i>Lincoln</i>. The next year, Cooper was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in&nbsp;<i>American Hustle</i>, but it&nbsp;was Jared Leto who won the Oscar that time. The third time, he&nbsp;was nominated for his leading part in&nbsp;<i>American Sniper,</i> but he&nbsp;was overshadowed by&nbsp;Eddie Redmayne who played Stephen Hawking.</p><p>His 2019&nbsp;project, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>A&nbsp;Star Is&nbsp;Born,</i> </a>where he&nbsp;was the movie director, the producer, the scriptwriter, and the leading actor, offered him multiple <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nominations</a> and wins in&nbsp;every major award ceremony. We&nbsp;hope that he&nbsp;will eventually win this very long-awaited and well-deserved statuette.</p><p><h2>3. Saoirse Ronan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dc6/502/71b26f5b16a410a18075064e65.jpg><p>Saoirse Ronan is&nbsp;only 27&nbsp;but has already participated in&nbsp;the race for the most prestigious movie award 4&nbsp;times. Her first nomination took place when she was only 13&nbsp;years old and it&nbsp;was for her part in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Atonement</i></a>. Then she was one of&nbsp;the Best Actress nominees for her part in&nbsp;<i>Brooklyn,</i> and in&nbsp;2019, she almost won the award for her leading part in&nbsp;<i>Lady Bird</i>.</p><p>Ronan is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the examples of&nbsp;a&nbsp;successful, early acting career. But during 2019’s ceremony, she had to&nbsp;compete with power players like Frances McDormand (60&nbsp;years old) and Meryl Streep (68&nbsp;years old). Ronan <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> in&nbsp;her interview that she isn’t competitive about awards and that the nomination itself felt like a&nbsp;victory to&nbsp;her.</p><p><h2>4. Helena Bonham Carter<br></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d3e/e96/f7a663512ea062a7363dceaf07.jpg><p>Tim Burton’s muse and the leading star of&nbsp;his films has been nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar twice. The first time took place in&nbsp;1998 when she got a&nbsp;Best Actress nomination for <i>The Wings of&nbsp;the Dove</i>. The second time, it&nbsp;was in&nbsp;2011 when she was nominated in&nbsp;the Best Supporting Actress category for her part in&nbsp;the historical drama, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The King’s Speech</i></a>. Alas, both times, luck wasn’t on&nbsp;Carter’s side. It’s interesting that she didn’t win any awards and wasn’t even nominated for anything for her outstanding performance as&nbsp;Marla in&nbsp;<i>Fight Club.</i></p><p>Carter’s stroke of&nbsp;bad luck when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;awards isn’t just with the Oscars. She’s also a&nbsp;9-time Golden Globe nominee and never won. Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;possible that her image is&nbsp;too bodacious for conservative members of&nbsp;the Academy?</p><p><h2>5. Johnny Depp</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/144/1d3/8ed68f547180e576c1649c1af7.jpg><p>Throughout his long acting career, Depp has been nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar 3&nbsp;times. In&nbsp;2004, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;Best Actor nomination for Pirates of&nbsp;the Caribbean: The Curse of&nbsp;the Black Pearl, but he&nbsp;lost to&nbsp;Sean Penn in&nbsp;the movie Mystic River. Next year he&nbsp;was nominated for his leading part in&nbsp;Finding Neverland but he&nbsp;lost again. In&nbsp;2008, Depp was nominated again for his leading part in&nbsp;the musical drama <a href=#>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of&nbsp;Fleet Street</a>, but he&nbsp;lost to&nbsp;Daniel Day-Lewis.</p><p>Depp says in&nbsp;his interviews that he&nbsp;isn’t interested in&nbsp;awards. After the Black Mass release, which was positively taken by&nbsp;European and American critics, he&nbsp;mentioned that “he&nbsp;never wanted to&nbsp;win an&nbsp;Oscar,” he&nbsp;acted not for the sake of&nbsp;winning awards, but for his fans.</p><p><h2>6. Sharon Stone</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d40/e81/8821e2588387d5e5281c4e17b6.jpg><p><a href=# title="Sharon Stone" data-link=tag>Sharon Stone</a> has starred in&nbsp;more than 40&nbsp;feature films but she became a&nbsp;worldwide celebrity thanks to&nbsp;her part in&nbsp;Basic Instinct. As&nbsp;for the Oscars, she was nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar only once for her part in&nbsp;<a href=#>Casino</a> but the award went to&nbsp;Susan Sarandon that year.</p><p>Stone began her acting career in&nbsp;Hollywood pretty late too. She became famous at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;34. Before that she used to&nbsp;work as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model and took acting parts in&nbsp;B movies. Since she couldn’t find recognition in&nbsp;the USA, she moved her focus to&nbsp;Europe. They say that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;her who made the <a href=#>Cannes Film Festival</a> one of&nbsp;the most popular and highly-regarded movie festivals in&nbsp;the world, which is&nbsp;no&nbsp;less prestigious than the Academy Awards. In&nbsp;the 90s, Stone was the host and the encourager of&nbsp;the festival’s charitable event.</p><p><h2>7. Bill Murray</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2f1/278/c7ebe55877aa9b302dffb5f46d.jpg><p>This actor that is&nbsp;so&nbsp;loved by&nbsp;millions was nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar only once in&nbsp;2004 in&nbsp;the Best Actor category for his part in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Lost in&nbsp;Translation</i></a>. At&nbsp;that time, he&nbsp;lost to&nbsp;Sean Penn. It’s interesting that despite Murray’s parts in&nbsp;such iconic movies, like <i>Groundhog Day</i> and <i>Ghostbusters</i>, he’s never won any awards for them.</p><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his interviews, Murray <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a> that he&nbsp;had decided to&nbsp;not participate in&nbsp;the Oscars race anymore.</p><p><h2>8. Keanu Reeves</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ba/044/3543e05166b6b2ff16b07ba399.jpg><p>It’s hard to&nbsp;believe, but <a href=# title="Keanu Reeves" data-link=tag>Keanu Reeves</a> has never been nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar. He&nbsp;became a&nbsp;worldwide celebrity after successful movies like <i>Speed </i>and<i> Point Break</i>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Matrix</i></a> made him an&nbsp;iconic figure. Despite the fact that the movies he&nbsp;acted in&nbsp;won many awards, including the Oscar, he&nbsp;has only won MTV Movie Awards.</p><p>The reason why Reeves has never been nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar can be&nbsp;explained by&nbsp;the fact that he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;reputation for not being a&nbsp;really selective actor. He&nbsp;sometimes participates in&nbsp;projects that don’t have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;potential, like <i>Knock Knock</i> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Siberia</i></a>.</p><p><h2>9. Tom Cruise</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b14/2a6/87da3c5c60aef5e2b89d9acca7.jpg><p><a href=# title="Tom Cruise" data-link=tag>Tom Cruise</a> was nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar in&nbsp;the Best Actor category in&nbsp;1990 for the first time. It&nbsp;was for his part in&nbsp;the movie Born on&nbsp;the Fourth of&nbsp;July but he&nbsp;lost to&nbsp;Daniel Day-Lewis. The second time took place 7&nbsp;years later when Cruise was nominated for the award for his part in&nbsp;Jerry Maguire, but it&nbsp;was Geoffrey Rush who took the win that time. His third nomination was in&nbsp;the Best Supporting Actor category for his part in&nbsp;<a href=#>Magnolia.</a></p><p>Cruise’s situation can be&nbsp;explained by&nbsp;a&nbsp;theory called the <a href=#>Pitt-Hanks Continuum </a>which says that there are 2&nbsp;types of&nbsp;actors in&nbsp;Hollywood. The first type resembles Brad Pitt, the second one resembles Tom Hanks. The actors of&nbsp;the first type can consistently show excellent performance but they’ll never win the award. While the actors of&nbsp;the “Hanks” type can win an&nbsp;Oscar for their first successful work. You can’t argue with science. But we&nbsp;hope that Tom Cruise still has a&nbsp;good chance to&nbsp;win an&nbsp;Oscar in&nbsp;the future, just like Leonardo DiCaprio who had to&nbsp;wait for 20&nbsp;years for his first Oscar.</p><p><h2>10. Jessica Chastain</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b7e/1b2/da027f57128d97062e22e5027a.jpg><p>Real success came to&nbsp;<a href=# title="Jessica Chastain" data-link=tag>Jessica Chastain</a> after <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Help</i></a> was released. She was immediately nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar in&nbsp;the Best Supporting Actress category. However, she didn’t win the golden statue that time. The next year, she was nominated again for the movie, <i>Zero Dark Thirty</i>, but she lost to&nbsp;<a href=# title="Jennifer Lawrence" data-link=tag>Jennifer Lawrence</a>. She was also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nominated</a> for Best Actress at&nbsp;the 2022 Academy Awards.</p><p>Jessica Chastain began her acting career in&nbsp;movies pretty late by&nbsp;industry standards, as&nbsp;she was 33&nbsp;years old at&nbsp;the time she started. Besides, according to&nbsp;Chastain, she was told that she was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>too red and too old-fashioned </a>at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;her career. Luckily, she’s currently at&nbsp;the peak of&nbsp;her success and has a&nbsp;very good chance of&nbsp;winning a&nbsp;coveted Oscar in&nbsp;the near future.</p><p><h2>11. Will Smith</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/548/e7d/5dadf05b99923b2c8745b507c8.jpg><p>It’s hard to&nbsp;believe, but <a href=# title="Will Smith" data-link=tag>Will Smith</a> has won very few serious acting awards. At&nbsp;the same time, his acting has always been good no&nbsp;matter what genre he’s appearing&nbsp;in. His first nomination took place in&nbsp;2002 when he&nbsp;was nominated in&nbsp;the Best Actor category for the biopic, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Ali, </i></a>but he&nbsp;lost to&nbsp;Denzel Washington.&nbsp;5&nbsp;years later, he&nbsp;was nominated again for his leading part in&nbsp;<i>The Pursuit of&nbsp;Happyness</i> where he&nbsp;acted together with his son, Jaden, but he&nbsp;didn’t win an&nbsp;Oscar then either.</p><p>In&nbsp;2016, Smith and his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>accused</a> the Academy Awards of&nbsp;racism and urged people of&nbsp;color to&nbsp;refrain from participating in&nbsp;the event. However, in&nbsp;2022, he&nbsp;was once again nominated for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Best Actor</a> in&nbsp;the Academy Awards for his role in&nbsp;<i>King Richard.</i></p><p><h2>12. Michelle Williams</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f40/57f/c9005a58f2b525510758648950.jpg><p>Williams has been an&nbsp;Oscar runner-up 4&nbsp;times. 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;the times she was nominated were in&nbsp;the Best Actress category for the movies Blue Valentine and <a href=#>My&nbsp;Week with Marilyn</a>. Michelle had to&nbsp;gain 22&nbsp;pounds for the part of&nbsp;Marilyn. The other 2&nbsp;times she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in&nbsp;the movies Brokeback Mountain and Manchester by&nbsp;the Sea. And for her work last year on&nbsp;All the Money in&nbsp;the World, she wasn’t even nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar.</p><p>Recently, the actress decided to&nbsp;switch from deep and dramatic roles to&nbsp;more simple projects like I&nbsp;Feel Pretty and <a href=#>Venom</a>.</p><p><h2>13. Keira Knightley</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e69/ab9/6ef9115260b1e5611432c383f1.jpg><p>At&nbsp;her current age of&nbsp;37, Keira has starred in&nbsp;many successful films and has been nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar twice. The first nomination took place in&nbsp;2006 for her part in&nbsp;<i>Pride &&nbsp;Prejudice</i>. The second one happened recently in&nbsp;2015 for her part in&nbsp;the historical drama, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Imitation Game</i></a>.</p><p>Despite her wide variety of&nbsp;roles and positive feedback from critics, she seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;unlucky with the Oscars. However, she’s recently become a&nbsp;mother, and we&nbsp;hope her best roles and awards are yet to&nbsp;come.</p><p><h2>14. Robert Downey&nbsp;Jr.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1f7/200/d1e9ad581f9d80d61087a367f6.jpg><p>The situation with Robert Downey&nbsp;Jr. also seems unfair. He&nbsp;was first nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar a&nbsp;long time ago in&nbsp;1993 for Best Actor in&nbsp;<a href=#>Chaplin</a>. At&nbsp;that time he&nbsp;lost to&nbsp;Al&nbsp;Pacino. The second and the last time took place in&nbsp;2009 when he&nbsp;was nominated in&nbsp;the Best Supporting Actor category for Tropic Thunder. However, during the 2009&nbsp;ceremony, all the other nominees had no&nbsp;chance of&nbsp;winning, because Heath Ledger had been posthumously awarded the Oscar for his unforgettable part as&nbsp;the Joker in&nbsp;The Dark Knight.</p><p>Currently, Robert Downey&nbsp;Jr. is&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;Tony Stark by&nbsp;many. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;classic example of&nbsp;how a&nbsp;good actor has become a&nbsp;hostage to&nbsp;one single character. However, he&nbsp;recently confessed that he&nbsp;wasn’t going to&nbsp;play Iron Man any longer. He&nbsp;said that at&nbsp;his current age of&nbsp;53, he’d look pathetic in&nbsp;a&nbsp;superhero suit.</p><p><h2>15. Glenn Close</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/407/783/93e849502eb3c86b5777023d01.jpg><p>Many people know Glenn Close for her part as&nbsp;Cruella De&nbsp;Vil in&nbsp;the <i>101 Dalmatians</i> movies. But very few are aware that Close has been nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar 8&nbsp;times during her 36-year-long career. It’s worth mentioning that her first 5&nbsp;nominations took place back in&nbsp;the ’80s. Her last nomination took place in&nbsp;2020 for her role as&nbsp;Bonnie “Mamaw” Vance in&nbsp;<i>Hillbilly Elegy</i>.</p><p>Perhaps the actress has been unlucky with who she’s gone up&nbsp;against because she’s been losing to&nbsp;actresses like Jessica Lange, Cher, and Meryl Streep.</p><p>Why do&nbsp;you think these actors haven’t won an&nbsp;Oscar? Share your ideas in&nbsp;the comments below.</p><p>Recent sightings of&nbsp;Shakira and Tom Cruise together have set the rumor mill abuzz, with fans and media speculating about a&nbsp;potential <a href=#>romantic relationship</a> between the two stars. Their camaraderie during the 2023 Miami Formula One Grand Prix, where they were seen laughing and chatting, has only added fuel to&nbsp;the fire. Sources close to&nbsp;the situation suggest there’s undeniable chemistry between the duo, with Cruise reportedly being “extremely interested” in&nbsp;pursuing Shakira.
