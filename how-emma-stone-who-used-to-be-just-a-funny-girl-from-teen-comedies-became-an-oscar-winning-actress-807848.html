But she has already taken part in&nbsp;40&nbsp;projects, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>won</a> an&nbsp;Oscar, Golden Globe, Volpi Cup, and Screen Actors Guild Award. She has also become one of&nbsp;the highest-paid actresses in&nbsp;the world, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>earning</a> $26 million in&nbsp;2017. But it&nbsp;seems that, at&nbsp;the beginning, she played in&nbsp;teen comedies and only dreamed of&nbsp;serious roles until just recently.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;study her acting career and see how her <a href=# title=movie data-link=tag>movie</a> roles have changed over the years.</p><p><h2>2002–2006: Persistence and a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;TV series</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/342/b7e/eb41aa5f6b82e67247b347436f.jpg><p>The future star was born to&nbsp;quite an&nbsp;ordinary family. Her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>father</a> was the founder and CEO of&nbsp;a&nbsp;general contracting company, and her mother was a&nbsp;homemaker. So, no&nbsp;one would expect that their daughter would win every major film award a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;decades later.</p><p>But, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, Emily (this is&nbsp;her real <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>name</a>) <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dreamed</a> of&nbsp;doing sketch comedy, so&nbsp;she took part in&nbsp;many productions at&nbsp;her local Youth Theater. She also dreamed of&nbsp;auditions in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>, so&nbsp;she persuaded her parents to&nbsp;move to&nbsp;Hollywood, which was thousands of&nbsp;miles away from her home. 14-year-old Emily even made a&nbsp;PowerPoint <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>presentation</a> with photos of&nbsp;celebrities and Madonna <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>songs</a>. And it&nbsp;worked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bc8/93e/3a6ab258f181673fccda5ffab0.jpg><p>After moving to&nbsp;Hollywood, Emily started homeschooling and spent all her time at&nbsp;auditions. Unfortunately, her auditions were unsuccessful, so&nbsp;she had to&nbsp;work part-time at&nbsp;a&nbsp;dog-treat bakery. However, dogs <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>didn’t</a> want to&nbsp;eat her cookies.</p><p>“I&nbsp;think 3&nbsp;people called my&nbsp;specific cookies inedible to&nbsp;their dogs. I’m not a&nbsp;super-talented dog baker.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/df9/fa7/f142d65984959277723986d75c.jpg><p>Finally, Emily appeared on&nbsp;television. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>took part</a> in&nbsp;the talent competition reality show <i>In&nbsp;Search of&nbsp;the New Partridge Family </i>and even became one of&nbsp;the winners. However, the show remained an&nbsp;unsold pilot. After that, she landed roles in&nbsp;other&nbsp;TV shows, which got canceled quickly due to&nbsp;low ratings.</p><p>But Emily didn’t give&nbsp;up. During the following 3&nbsp;years, she appeared in&nbsp;4&nbsp;other more successful and long-lasting TV&nbsp;shows, like <i>Malcolm in&nbsp;the Middle</i>. Then she learned that another Emily Stone was already registered with the Screen Actors Guild, and the actress decided to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>change</a> her name to&nbsp;Emma.</p><p><h2>2007–2010: Her first movie role and a&nbsp;“funny girl” type of&nbsp;character</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b27/f61/5fdc795769841cfcdee1c72660.jpg><p>4&nbsp;years of&nbsp;never-ending auditions and different&nbsp;TV shows later, Emma landed a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;the typical teen comedy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Superbad</i></a>. The movie became so&nbsp;popular that it&nbsp;was nominated for a&nbsp;few MTV Movie Awards, and Emma won a&nbsp;Young Hollywood Award as&nbsp;Exciting New Face. By&nbsp;the way, Emma <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dyed</a> her hair red right before taking part in&nbsp;<i>Superbad</i>, and this color eventually became her trademark.</p><p>After the movie premier, producers finally realized that her ability to&nbsp;laugh at&nbsp;herself and to&nbsp;switch from being funny to&nbsp;touching and vice versa was a&nbsp;real find for any teen comedy. This is&nbsp;why Emma’s filmography includes so&nbsp;many stereotypical movies similar to&nbsp;this one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3d4/7e6/ed684d5f8e93a01735286514e8.jpg><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;funny girl, the actress appeared in&nbsp;movies like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Rocker</i></a><i>, </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The House Bunny</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Ghosts of&nbsp;Girlfriends Past</i></a>. But in&nbsp;the movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Zombieland</i></a>, her most successful movie of&nbsp;those years, her character only seemed nice. She could easily deceive Woody Harrelson’s character and cope with hordes of&nbsp;zombies.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, Woody Harrelson introduced Emma to&nbsp;Paul McCartney when paying him a&nbsp;friendly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>visit</a>. After some time, the actress dared to&nbsp;write to&nbsp;the singer asking him to&nbsp;draw birds’ feet as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reference to&nbsp;his song <i>Blackbird</i>, which she and her mother loved. Later, Emma and her mother used this design in&nbsp;their tattoos, which they got to&nbsp;celebrate the fact that Emma’s mother had overcome <a href=# title=cancer data-link=tag>cancer</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cfc/7ae/4e544458e0b9e09e08c3208a75.jpg><p>Among other movies of&nbsp;those years, Emma loves to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recall</a> her work in&nbsp;the movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Paper Man</i></a> (2009) which disappointed critics but allowed her to&nbsp;play her first dramatic role. By&nbsp;the way, critics were quite happy with the acting.</p><p>Emma rose to&nbsp;fame a&nbsp;year later, after starring in&nbsp;the teen comedy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Easy A</i></a>. This sweet and funny movie became very popular and received positive critical reviews. And Emma won an&nbsp;MTV Movie Award and was even nominated for a&nbsp;Golden Globe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e87/051/1a23d75b9f847a9206fc31cb19.jpg><p>“It’s no&nbsp;surprise that her career is&nbsp;taking off. Emma is&nbsp;very, very smart. It’s clear in&nbsp;the choices she made. She knows what she’s done well but has really pushed herself and challenged herself.”</p><p>A&nbsp;year later, Emma worked with <a href=# title="Ryan Gosling" data-link=tag>Ryan Gosling</a> for the first time. There was a&nbsp;real chemistry between these actors in&nbsp;the romantic comedy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Crazy, Stupid, Love</i></a> and the scene with the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Dirty Dancing</i></a> lift was really memorable. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, the movie was a&nbsp;commercial success. But Emma began to&nbsp;feel tired of&nbsp;being typecast as&nbsp;“the sarcastic interest of&nbsp;the guy.”</p><p><h2>2011–2015: More and more serious roles</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/45e/7ab/62ebe35958aca7d28ca803c2eb.jpg><p>Slowly, Emma began to&nbsp;move away from this type of&nbsp;character. In&nbsp;2011, she starred in&nbsp;the movie <i>The Help</i>, which won a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>awards</a> and finally let Emma reveal her dramatic potential.</p><p>But a&nbsp;year later, the actress got involved in&nbsp;a&nbsp;romantic relationship again, which was a&nbsp;relationship with a&nbsp;superhero. The role in&nbsp;<i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i> film series made her even more famous, and she decided to&nbsp;use this publicity for the greater good. When she and her co-star Andrew Garfield saw the lurking paparazzi, they would cover their faces with signs <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a> that this attention could be&nbsp;drawn to&nbsp;certain charity organizations, the list of&nbsp;which was written on&nbsp;the signs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bed/ff9/d940a35de1b38aec4a9ce3282c.jpg><p>Her success provided Emma with an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;choose her roles more carefully. She starred alongside Ryan Gosling again in&nbsp;the stylish action thriller <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Gangster Squad</i></a><i>,</i> which received negative critical reviews, even though critics praised Stone and Gosling’s acting.</p><p>And in&nbsp;2014, Emma managed to&nbsp;land a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;Woody Allen’s movie. A&nbsp;sarcastic red-haired girl was the perfect fit for his movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Magic in&nbsp;the Moonlight</i></a>. Later, the director invited her again to&nbsp;play in&nbsp;his movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Irrational Man</i></a>. But even these roles didn’t become Emma’s greatest success.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dd0/cf9/c75e1f5646bfaa3dd261fbc002.jpg><p>Also in&nbsp;2014, the actress took part in&nbsp;the Oscar-winning and iconic movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Birdman</i></a>. Emma’s character, a&nbsp;girl disappointed in&nbsp;life and her father, turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;so&nbsp;powerful that the actress was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nominated</a> for an&nbsp;Oscar. Even though she didn’t receive the coveted statuette, her talent and acting skills were praised by&nbsp;both critics and viewers.</p><p>“Stone is&nbsp;maybe the best she’s ever been, delivering a&nbsp;snarling monologue at&nbsp;one point that is&nbsp;basically a&nbsp;manifesto for the modern millennial, and then tempering it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;tiny beat at&nbsp;the end that kinda deserves an&nbsp;Oscar all by&nbsp;itself.”</p><p><h2>2016–2021: Oscars and many other interesting things</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/962/918/ab76315296a7eb3aa0d435411a.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2016, Emma’s career reached incredible heights. She starred in&nbsp;the musical comedy-drama <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>La&nbsp;La&nbsp;Land</i></a>, which won a&nbsp;huge number of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>awards</a>: 6&nbsp;Oscars and 7&nbsp;Golden Globes. By&nbsp;the way, Emma won one of&nbsp;each of&nbsp;these awards personally for Best Actress.</p><p>After that, there were the sports comedy-drama <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Battle of&nbsp;the Sexes</i></a>, the historical movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Favourite</i></a>, which also won a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>awards</a>, and the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Maniac</i></a> TV&nbsp;series where Emma played many versions of&nbsp;her character and showed all the facets of&nbsp;her talent. But Emma doesn’t lose her head about this striking success, and even makes jokes about&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7f6/6e2/2c863f507e80ceb9223c6be30b.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;don’t like the idea that anybody thinks that this&nbsp;is, like, special. My&nbsp;job is&nbsp;fun and it’s wonderful and it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;hard. There are really hard jobs in&nbsp;the world, like really hard, and everyone is&nbsp;being so&nbsp;nice to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and bringing me&nbsp;a&nbsp;coffee.”</p><p>But this is&nbsp;not the full list of&nbsp;Emma’s brilliant roles. In&nbsp;2021, the stylish and rebellious movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Cruella</i></a> was released, which conquered the hearts of&nbsp;the audience. Cruella is&nbsp;mean and crazy, but she’s so&nbsp;beautiful.</p><p>“This dazzling visual feast is&nbsp;awfully fun to&nbsp;watch whenever its leading ladies lock horns.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a4c/da7/2197915d34804cb91bb1c11b3a.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the near future, Emma will take part in&nbsp;the screen <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adaptation</a> of&nbsp;Alasdair Gray’s novel <i>Poor Things</i>. In&nbsp;the movie, the actress will appear as&nbsp;a&nbsp;female variation of&nbsp;Frankenstein brought back to&nbsp;life by&nbsp;Willem Dafoe’s character. And we&nbsp;are sure that Emma won’t let her fans down.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/00e/42b/82d3845472827dd08822b6ea7a.jpg><p>What do&nbsp;you think about Emma Stone?
