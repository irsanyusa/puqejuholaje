Once you leave MC Assets, any Information you provide at another website will be governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the website you are visiting. The privacy policies of third party websites will differ from ours.</p><p>Please note that if you make a purchase through a third party website, the privacy policy of the third party website will govern the use and distribution of your credit card number or other financial information.</p><p><strong>COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES</strong></p><p>To help make MC Assets more responsive to the needs of users, including when you navigate and use MC Media as an MC Job Applicant, Morning Consult employs a standard feature of browser software called a “cookie.” Cookies are text files that assign each user a unique, random number and are stored in the internet browser or by the internet browser on a user’s computer system. Cookies do not personally identify the user; they merely identify the browser/computer with which the user accesses a given website. Unless users voluntarily identify themselves (e.g., through a subscription to information available via MC Media, or as an Authorized User, Authenticated User, or Subscriber), we will be unable to identify the identity of users through MC Assets, even if a cookie is assigned to users’ computers.</p><p>The personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by a user. Cookies prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences in certain areas of MC Assets where you have previously entered preference information. Most web browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies, you may render your computer unable to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users of MC Assets.</p><p>MC Assets’ servers automatically collect limited information about your computer’s connection to the Internet, including your IP address. The IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send data – such as the web pages users view.</p><p>Morning Consult also uses web beacons (also known as “single-pixel GIFs”) to access cookies and to count users who visit MC Assets or open Morning Consult’s HTML-formatted email messages, as well as to track device identification statistics and other non-identifying information for the purpose of analytics, push notifications, and error reporting. These analytics are provided to third party vendors.</p><p>With respect to your application for employment with us, some of our online recruiting activities are hosted by third parties. When you access sites operated by these third parties, they may place cookies and other tracking technologies on your device.</p><p><strong>Do Not Track Notice –</strong></p><p>Morning Consult takes privacy and security very seriously, and strives to put our users first in all aspects of our business. With regard to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals, Morning Consult currently does not respond to DNT signals in browsers because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a standard once one is created.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</strong></p><p>This children’s privacy statement explains Morning Consult’s practices with respect to the online collection and use of personal information from children under the age of 13 and provides important information on children’s and parental rights under federal law with respect to such information.</p><p><u>MC Assets</u>: MC Assets are not directed to children under the age of 13 and Morning Consult does NOT knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. By subscribing to MC Media and/or registering for MC Products, you represent and warrant that you are 13 years of age or older. By registering for MC Pro you represent and warrant that you are at least 13 years old if you are in the United States or the United Kingdom, and 16 years old anywhere else.

In addition, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to fill out our forms or send any Information about yourself to us.</p><p>If Morning Consult becomes aware that it has inadvertently received personal information from a user under the age of 13, Morning Consult will delete such information from Morning Consult’s records. Because Morning Consult does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13, Morning Consult also does NOT knowingly distribute any such information to third parties. Morning Consult does NOT knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to distribute personal contact information. If you learn that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please alert us at <a href=#>privacy@morningconsult.com</a>.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER</strong></p><p>Our computer systems are currently based in the United States.
