The premise of the show, which is hosted by <a href=# rel=noopener>Nick Lachey</a>, Netflix’s go-to romance show host, is <a href=# rel=noopener>the stuff of reality TV dreams</a>: assemble a group of hot and horny singles on a tropical island, where they’ll compete to form relationships—consider it the ultimate dating competition.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Forming real connections, ironic though it might seem in a reality TV dating competition, turns out to be the key to succeeding on Perfect Match, as the most compatible couples will be given the opportunity to try their own hands at matchmaking, by breaking up other couples and sending them on dates with new singles they’ll invite to the villa.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To cast the show, producers turned to the stars of nine of Netflix’s other reality shows, selecting a combination of fan favorites and villains from the series Love Is Blind, <a href=# rel=noopener>The Circle</a>, The Circle: France, The Mole, Selling Tampa, <a href=# rel=noopener>Sexy Beasts</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Too Hot To Handle</a>, Twentysomethings, and <a href=# rel=noopener>The Ultimatum.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>From Love Is Blind to The Circle, Netflix Is Getting Terrifyingly Good at Reality TV</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The episodes will release in batches of four, with the first four dropping on Feb. 14 and new episodes debuting every week on Tuesdays.

The 27-year-old bartender, who is originally from Houston and attended the University of San Diego, made a splash on her show when it was revealed that she was previously married as a 20-year-old (she divorced in 2021, shortly before filming the series), a fact that she didn’t immediately reveal to her housemates. Humphreys identifies as bisexual and came out publicly in the first episode of <i>Twentysomethings.</i></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Anne-Sophie Petit-Frere</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Netflix’s Selling Tampa, a spinoff of the popular <a href=#>Selling Sunset real estate series</a>, Anne-Sophie Petit-Frere is one of the show’s power players. The 28-year-old property accountant-turned-real estate professional is one of the top agents at Tampa’s Allure Realty, doing so well that in 2021, she became the first agent at the firm to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“cap,”</a> which means she’s producing enough to no longer have to split commissions with the firm; she was also named the realty’s “Agent of the Year.” Petit-Frere, who was born in Haiti and moved to the U.S. in 2005, attended the University of South Florida.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Perfect_Match_S1_E5_00_51_28_00_R.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Bartise Bowden</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bartise Bowden emerged as one of the more controversial characters on season 3 of Netflix’s wildly popular <a href=#>dating reality series </a><i>Love Is Blind</i>, due to a messy love triangle and a polarizing opinion on reproductive rights. The 27-year-old CPA, who hails from Dallas, Texas and attended the University of Texas at Dallas, faced drama on the show when he proposed to one woman, but continued to compare her to another contestant he had feelings for; unsurprisingly, the couple did not end up tying the knot, with Bowden backing out at the altar. Bowden also faced criticism from viewers after he came out in opposition to abortion during a discussion with his then-fiancée, who advocated that only women should be able to choose what happens to their bodies. Since season 3 ended, Bowden has <a href=# rel=noopener>walked back his stance on the issue.</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Calvin Crooks</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Calvin Crooks was eliminated fairly early from Netflix’s influencer reality show, <i>The Circle</i>, but his time on the series definitely left an impression. The 32-year-old fitness trainer and vegetarian nutritionist who hails from Miami, FL also previously held a job as a junior software engineer. Before he was a reality TV star, Crooks also played for professional football clubs in England and Iceland.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Chase DeMoor</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Chase DeMoor showed he was a player on and off the field when he appeared on season 2 of Netflix’s dating show, <i>Too Hot To Handle, </i>the series where frisky singles have to choose between having sex or winning a $100,000 grand prize. DeMoor had a dramatic romance—and an equally dramatic split on the show, helping to make him one of the fan favorites of the season. A former NFL hopeful, who played for the Houston Linemen in the Spring League, the 26-year-old athlete is now a professional boxer with over 1 million followers on Instagram.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>FBoy Island and Sexy Beasts Represent the Best and Worst of 2021’s Trashy Summer Dating Shows</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Perfect_Match_S1_E6_00_05_02_10_R.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Chloe Veitch</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When it comes to Netflix’s reality TV offerings, Chloe Veitch is an all-star. The 23-year-old British model and former beauty queen appeared on the first season of <i>Too Hot To Handle</i>, where she emerged as a fan favorite and a joint winner at the end of the show. Following her stint on <i>Too Hot to Handle, </i>she appeared on season 2 of <i>The Circle, </i>where she struck up a flirtation with fellow <i>Perfect Match </i>contestant Mitchell Eason.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Colony Reeves</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Netflix viewers may remember Colony Reeves as a vivacious part of <i>Selling Tampa, </i>which was canceled after just one season on the streaming platform, but it looks like the 31-year-old real estate agent hasn’t given up on reality TV yet, having joined the cast of <i>Perfect Match</i>. Reeves, who’s a Tampa native, wasn’t always in the business of selling homes, however; after graduating from the University of South Florida, she became a teacher, but later found her true calling as a real estate agent.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Damian Powers</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Damian Powers was last on a Netflix show, he had misgivings about committing to his then-fiancée, Giannina Gibelli, eventually leaving her at the altar. The 31-year-old, who was born in Germany and currently lives in Atlanta, is now a full-time influencer, and has since struck up a friendship with Too Hot To Handle‘s Francesca Farago, with the two potentially exploring a romance on Perfect Match.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Diamond Jack</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When it comes to love on-screen, Diamond Jack has had some pretty memorable storylines. The 31-year-old former NBA dancer, who now works at a cancer nonprofit, appeared on the first season of <i>Love Is Blind</i>, where she was engaged to Carlton Morton, a relationship that was short-lived and ended acrimoniously with drinks being thrown and her engagement ring flung into a swimming pool. Two years later, at the reunion special for the show, <i>Love Is Blind</i>: <i>After the Altar</i>, Jack had a blind date that went awry with Rumeal, a friend of her friend’s boyfriend, leading to her being abandoned at an event.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Perfect_Match_S1_E6_00_08_53_08_R.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Dom Gabriel</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dom Gabriel was one of the most charismatic newcomers to Netflix’s reboot of The Mole, where he played a heavy machine operator. Outside of reality television, the Toronto native is the lead singer and songwriter of the band, Don’t Call, and an avid creator on TikTok.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Francesca Farago</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Francesca Farago became one of the most infamous cast members of Too Hot to Handle, after she and fellow cast member Harry Jowsey had sex while knowing that their physical intimacy would take away from the entire cast’s overall cash prize. The 29-year-old YouTube creator and influencer from Vancouver, British Columbia, had a tempestuous relationship with Jowsey, that culminated in him proposing to her at the show’s reunion, but the pair ultimately called it quits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Perfect_Match_S1_E5_00_52_26_21_R.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Georgia Hassarati</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Georgia Hassarati left a definite impression on season 3 of Too Hot To Handle, where she established herself as a heartbreaker. The 26-year-old midwife student, who is from Brisbane, Australia, formerly dated another Too Hot To Handle alum, Harry Jowsey. Her former relationship may cause some waves in the villa, as Harry was in a passionate relationship with Francesca, another Perfect Match contestant, on season 1 of the Too Hot To Handle.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Netflix’s New Dating Show Too Hot to Handle Is Unabashedly Trashy.

While the 31-year-old recruiter, who lives in Atlanta, GA., professed that she only wanted to date Barnett, following the show’s end, she later briefly dated Batten’s ex-fiancé, Mark Cuevas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Perfect_Match_S1_E7_00_37_45_11_R.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Mitchell Eason</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mitchell Eason is no stranger to flirting on camera.
