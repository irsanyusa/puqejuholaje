<time>01 Jan 0001, 00:00</time></div></div><p>I’ve only heard good things about Velotric’s lineup of e-bikes, so I was excited when they reached out for me to test ride their then-upcoming Discover 2 Commuter E-bike. Unfortunately, there are plenty of underwhelming e-bikes that aren’t as rugged, comfortable, or user-friendly as they should be considering the average price of one of these rides. But I’m happy to say that the Discover 2 is an excellent investment for anyone who needs an e-bike with tank-like durability that cruises like a dream.</p><p>Long before I heard from Velotric, I remember seeing the vibrant, mango-yellow Discover during my research on how to choose an electric bike. Its new counterpart greatly improves upon the original with its higher top speed, longer maximum range, big and bold color display, notably more powerful motor, and a slew of other upgrades for just $100 more than the original. Yes, the Discover 2 sounds great on paper, but I wanted to put this admittedly cool-looking minty green e-bike through its paces in a variety of environments to see how comfortable, versatile, and user-friendly it was for myself.</p><p>After cruising at speeds of just under 28 mph on rough jungle-lined backroads, punishing its brakes alongside heavy traffic downtown, and spending more time with it than I initially intended just because I was having so much fun, I fully endorse the Velotric Discovery 2 as one of the best electric commuter bikes for those who need a long-lasting and cozy ride that’s absolutely worth their hard-earned dollars.</p><h2 id=unboxing-and-first-impressions>Unboxing and first impressions</h2><p>As much as I enjoy riding <a rel=alternate href=#>(the best) e-bikes</a>, assembling them isn’t nearly as fun. However, Velotric has the most user-friendly instruction manual I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading to put together a bike, and while it still took a little time, every step was crystal-clear and it was done before I knew it.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/fc8723dd4ab78da4238be790830cb68f/76902/velotric-discover-2-shed-parked.jpg></span></span><p>I opted for the slick mint color variant of the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Discover 2</a>, and I’m glad I did, as its pastel matte green colors give this expertly designed ride that much more personality. Although this bike weighs in at a beefy 63 pounds, it really doesn’t feel like it due to the even weight distribution, and once you get going, you’ll forget all about the extra heft when zooming down the road.</p><p>If you’ve ever wondered, “<a rel=alternate href=#>What is an electric bike?</a>,” they are essentially normal bikes coupled with a battery-powered motor. An e-bike’s motor activates when the rider pedals or its throttle is activated, adding additional power for easily climbing up steep slopes, covering long distances without getting winded, and helping with carrying extra cargo.</p><p>Its controls are user-friendly and intuitive. I love its big color display that lays out key stats like current speed, distance traveled, battery life, etc. It’s so bright and bold, which makes it easy to read at a glance even in ultra-bright and sunny weather. I did not expect having the front wheel brake attached to the left hand brake and the back wheel tied to the right. While I always relied on the rear brake, it was nice to know that I could stop the front wheel independently if I ever needed it. I’m also used to a motorcycle-like throttle, but the D2’s trigger throttle is comfortable and easy to activate for a boost of self-propelled speed at a moment’s notice.</p><h2 id=velotric-discover-2-pros-and-cons>Velotric Discover 2 pros and cons</h2><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>High-power engine soars up inclines and over rougher terrain</li><li>Speedy throttle accelerates to your selected speed quickly</li><li>Premium brakes stop on a dime</li><li>Highly adjustable components for the perfect fit for your size</li><li>Bright screen and user-friendly controls</li><li>Rugged water resistant design</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Heavy frame and parts, but you’ll only notice it if you ever need to manually lift the bike off the ground</li></ul><h2 id=velotric-discover-2-price>Velotric Discover 2 price</h2><p>Both the regular (comfortably seats riders between 4’11” to 5’9”) and large (made for taller riders from 5’6” to 6’4”) Velotric Discover 2 are priced at $1,699. Two different bundles are also available. Bundle A adds on front and rear baskets for a total price of $1,879. Bundle B, priced at $1,942, includes the same plus a phone mount and a mirror.</p><p><h3 class=title>Velotric Discover 2 E-Bike</h3></p><h2 id=key-features>Key features</h2><h3>Powerful motor</h3><p>Its 750 watt motor (with an unlockable maximum of 1,100 watts) flies up hills and inclines, rapidly reaching top speeds. Its throttle trigger is comfortable to use whenever you need a boost of speed or simply don’t feel like pedaling anymore.</p><h3>Durability</h3><p>The Discover 2 sports an extremely rugged frame and sturdy components, as well as a waterproof design and even higher IPX7 waterproof rating for its battery. Don’t be afraid to ride it in the rain or rinse it off at home — this e-bike will shrug off water like a duck.</p><h3>Display</h3><p>Its extra-bright, colorful screen is a treat to use mid-ride, as its large display is easy to read at a glance in harsh sunlight. Plus it packs plenty of important information on the screen at the same time. I also liked the ability to tilt the display to match my height for easier viewing.</p><h3>Quality brakes</h3><p>Impressively powerful brakes for quick stops, easing down to a lower speed, and the ability to individually control both the front and rear brakes are an extra level of control I didn’t know I’d appreciate.</p><h3>Security features</h3><p>The D2 features a bold red LED brake light, a pair of blinkers that are comfortable to reach and activate when needed, and an extra-bright headlight for when the sun sets. It also includes a lockable battery compartment and Apple Find My so users can keep tabs on their bike’s global position from their iPhone or PC.</p><h3>Adjustability</h3><p>The highly adjustable handlebars and seat suit riders of all heights.</p><h3>Nice extras</h3><p>The USB-C port is a fun bonus for mapping routes, monitoring and avoiding high-traffic areas, and playing Pokémon Go with my iPhone on the handlebars like the nerd I am. Its ultra-rugged rear rack and high weight limit of 440 pounds makes this e-bike a top pick for comfortably hauling items around your neighborhood too.</p><h3>Specifications</h3><ul><li><strong>Frame:</strong> Triple-butted aluminum alloy (available in regular and large)</li><li><strong>Colors:</strong> Mint, cherry crimson, pine green, and stone grey</li><li><strong>Motor:</strong> 750 watt motor</li><li><strong>Battery:</strong> 48V, 705.6Wh</li><li><strong>Top speed:</strong> 28mph</li><li><strong>Max range:</strong> 75 miles (60 miles with the throttle)</li><li><strong>Brakes:</strong> 180mm hydraulic brakes</li><li><strong>Tires:</strong> Puncture resistant 2.4-inch wide</li><li><strong>Weight capacity:</strong> 440 pounds</li><li><strong>Tech:</strong> Color display, Apple Find My security, USB-C port</li><li><strong>Certification:</strong> UL2271 certified battery, IPX7 waterproof rating</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> $1,699.99 (both medium and large variants)</li></ul><h3>Throttle</h3><p>The Velotric Discovery 2 features a thumb-activated throttle trigger under the left handlebar. It feels comfortable to reach and activate with a press of your thumb. The powerful motor provides very high acceleration, and I’m glad the D2 includes five clearly indicated speed modes for light cruising to full-force zooming around. This extra power makes short work of all but the sharpest inclines, and while it’s fun to hit the throttle, it does eat up the battery much more quickly than utilizing a combination of pedaling and the throttle.</p><h3>LED screen</h3><p>While many e-bikes come with a dim little monochrome display, the Discover 2 stands apart from the crowd with its sizable three and a half-inch, full-color display. Its bright backlighting and polarized surface make it a snap to read in all weather conditions and times of day. I certainly appreciate that I can swap out on-screen data mid-ride at the tap of a button.</p><h3>Hydraulic disc brakes and stopping</h3><p>I wasn’t prepared for front and rear wheel brakes, and while I mainly relied on the rear brake, I see the value for the extra stopping power when you really need it. The D2 sports high-end, responsive brakes that both cut the motor and activate the tail light when used for an extra layer of safety.</p><h3>Padded and railed saddle</h3><p>While I like how its frame makes it easy for riders to step through or throw their leg over the Discover 2, as well as how simple it is to raise to accommodate a range of rider heights, the seat itself is just acceptable. The saddle isn’t bad by any means, but if your commute is a particularly bumpy one, it would be worth getting a plush upgrade like Velotric’s own<a rel=nofollow href=#> Double Spring Comfort Saddle</a>. Solid, but not awesome seat aside, its hydraulic suspension is excellent, and it’s a dependably smooth ride regardless of the terrain.</p><h3>Tires</h3><p>The D2’s 2.4-inch wide puncture-resistant tires pair well with its high-end suspension to easily shield riders from nasty bumps, dropping off curbs, and uneven ground.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/0493c9a6e762e4476a987db48c82d0e7/76902/velotric-discover-2-battery-front-wheel.jpg></span></span><h3>Front and rear lights</h3><p>Although I’m not much of a night rider, its especially bright, forward facing spotlight is an awesome lantern after dark and for inclement weather. I’m a big fan of how bright its rear-facing brake and blinker lights are, as well. Anyone who needs a commuter e-bike for high-traffic areas will appreciate this safety feature too.</p><h3>Rear rack</h3><p>Between its heavy-duty aluminum alloy design and its weight limit of 66 pounds, the Discovery 2 works well for hauling plenty of gear during your travels.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/91e0ff02e9a52713c616293c80b818ef/76902/velotric-discover-2-kickstand.jpg></span></span><h3>Kickstand</h3><p>The D2 features a kickstand connected to its rear tire. It has a wide base and is effortless to extend or retract while seated on the e-bike.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/0493c9a6e762e4476a987db48c82d0e7/76902/velotric-discover-2-battery-front-wheel.jpg></span></span><h3>Locking battery</h3><p>It includes a locking battery compartment with a pair of keys to keep your battery securely in place.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></span></span><h3>Apple Find My</h3><p>This innovative feature allows users to link the built-in tracker to their iPhone and monitor its location just like their Apple Watch or AirTag. Don’t be concerned if you aren’t familiar with iOS, as anyone can create an Apple Account and track their Discover 2’s location via iCloud.com.</p><h2 id=velotric-discover-2--is-it-for-you>Velotric Discover 2 — Is it for you?</h2><p>As both a regular commuter e-bike and a dependably fun way to cruise around your neck of the woods, I highly recommend the Velotric Discover 2. Its seamless pedal assist makes it a blast to pedal, and its snappy, high-acceleration throttle is easy to control and manage for the perfect burst of speed. Its heavy-duty components and waterproof design ensures its longevity. It’s loaded with safety features that urban riders will appreciate, in addition to a smooth front-wheel suspension and fat tires that provide a smooth ride on rough roads too. With a maximum range of 75 miles, it’s well-equipped for commuting to work, running errands, and taking exciting day trips.</p><p>The one and only potential downside about the Discover 2 is its weight. At 63 pounds, this hefty e-bike can be cumbersome to lift onto bike racks, into a truck, or haul up stairs. But if you’re planning on keeping yours on the ground, there are no notable issues with this bike. If you’re interested in exploring other brands of e-bikes, read my guide on the <a rel=alternate href=#>best electric commuter bikes</a>.</p><p><h3 class=title>Velotric Discover 2 E-Bike</h3></p><h2 id=velotric-discover-2-ride-and-comfort>Velotric Discover 2 ride and comfort</h2><p>Whether you’re riding downtown among crowded city streets or uneven dirt roads, the Velotric Discover 2 is a reliably steady and smooth ride. While its included saddle seat could use a bit more cushion for marathon riders, its front wheel suspension and wide tires excel at absorbing bumps in the road. It also sports the slickest pedal assist I’ve ever had the pleasure of riding with due to the 15 different torque sensor settings that provide extra support via its powerful motor based on how much effort you put into pedaling.</p><p>If you’re not in the mood to pedal around town, its throttle trigger feels natural to press, and feels zippy with its high acceleration. You’ll still get up to 60 miles per charge with the throttle alone, and it feels great to punch the accelerator on straightaways — the Discover 2 is just an all-around fun bike.</p><h2 id=velotric-discover-2-performance>Velotric Discover 2 performance</h2><h3>Ease of use/user friendliness</h3><p>The Velotric Discover 2’s controls and large color display make adjusting its top speed, viewing mid-ride data, and making other adjustments a breeze. While I thought that its collection of buttons were straightforward by default, the team at Velotric deserves praise for their expertly designed and user-friendly manual for how clearly it lays out every function the D2 has to offer.</p><p>Swapping between menus is quick and intuitive, its trigger throttle feels comfortable, and no matter which of its easily swappable top speeds you’re in the mood for, its strong motor and impressively speedy acceleration will get you there in seconds. It’s an all-around comfortable e-bike for both extended and shorter rides. The only upgrade I would suggest is a plush seat if you’re planning on tackling a particularly long and bumpy regular commute.</p><h2 id=velotric-discover-2-maintenance>Velotric Discover 2 maintenance</h2><p>The Discover 2 has a medium to low level of required maintenance, and that is in part due to its rugged waterproof design. Its IPX7 waterproof rating goes far beyond effortlessly surviving a rainstorm. The battery would endure being submerged underwater (not that you’d want to) and owners will appreciate the ability to hose down their ride without worrying about rust.</p><p>If you keep its battery charged and tend to it like you would a regular bike, the Discover 2 is especially easy to maintain.</p><h2 id=velotric-discover-2-design-and-build-quality>Velotric Discover 2 design and build quality</h2><p>One of the highlights I’ve mentioned repeatedly throughout my review is the premium durability of Velotric’s Discover 2. From its triple-butted aluminum alloy frame, to rubberized handlebar-mounted controls, every component feels premium and well-made. Expect this e-bike to endure for a long time to come before you need to replace or repair anything critical. But as a mild tradeoff, the rear rack, sizable battery, and the powerful motor itself all combine for an all-around heavier bike.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final verdict</h2><p>After spending plenty of time cruising along the beaches, busy city streets, and junkier backroads of my area, I can safely say that the Velotric Discover 2 is fairly priced for such a powerful, comfortable, and user-friendly e-bike. Its impressive range, and ability to effortlessly soar up slopes and over uneven terrain makes it a top-tier commuter bike. If you’re looking to invest in an e-bike that is almost guaranteed to last for a long time, the Discover 2 is an absolute must-buy for its incredible durability.
