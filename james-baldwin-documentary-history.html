Jackson, was written by James Baldwin, one of America’s foremost public intellectuals of the 20th century, who died in 1987. The main source material was a 30-page packet of letters obtained by Peck from Baldwin’s youngest sister, Gloria, that were notes for a book project called Remember This House, which Baldwin began to propose in the late 1970s but never got to write.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Remember This House was to be Baldwin’s magnum opus, a critique of American society from the viewpoint of the assassination of his friends <a href=# rel=noopener>Medgar Evers</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Malcolm X</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Martin Luther King Jr</a>. As Peck aptly notes in the introduction to the film’s <a href=# rel=noopener>companion book</a>, what these activists had in common had less to do with race and each man’s approach to the Black Liberation Movement, but rather that all three were “deemed dangerous” and “disposable.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So, though the film provides a provocative analysis of American race relations up to the present day, as a testament to Baldwin’s continued relevance, an understanding of the moment when Baldwin began the project can add another layer to the movie’s meaning.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Baldwin’s straight-no-chaser style of criticism, as captured in his essay collection The Fire Next Time, had made him a household name more than a decade earlier. As a 1963 <a href=#>TIM</a>E cover story about the author and activist noted, “in the U.S. today there is not another writer — white or black — who expresses with such poignancy and abrasiveness the dark realities of the racial ferment in North and South.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the heart of Baldwin’s argument was the question of who is responsible for the problem of racism, a point the film makes with Baldwin’s use of language. Never one to mince words, he wrote and spoke what Toni Morrison called in <a href=# rel=noopener>a 1987 remembrance</a> of her friend the “undecorated truth” about the American illusion, which juxtaposed whiteness as American innocence with blackness as sullying American purity hence, “the Negro Problem.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Such an illusion was based on what Jabari Asim in his book <a href=# rel=noopener>The N Word</a> dubbed one of America’s “founding fictions,” the invention of a specific term to define blacks as subhuman and to lend credence to notions of white supremacy. As Asim notes, “From the outset, the British and their colonial counterparts relied on language to maximize the idea of difference between themselves and their African captives.” Yet it was far more than just a word. Asim demonstrated how over the centuries the N word became the ideological justification that codified American society and its institutions.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One of the most striking moments in I Am Not Your Negro comes from a 1963 <a href=# rel=noopener>PBS interview</a> between Baldwin and the esteemed psychologist Kenneth Clark, whose research — produced with his research partner and wife <a href=# rel=noopener>Mamie Phipps Clark</a> — had influenced the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. The Board of Education. Baldwin, rejecting America’s founding fiction quipped, “I am not a ‘nigger,’ I am a man!” He asserted that “the future of the country” depended on white peoples’ ability to ask themselves “why it was necessary to have a ‘nigger’ in the first place” and why they would have invented that idea.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite his harsh criticism, Baldwin remained hopefully optimistic that American equality was achievable. The passage of the <a href=# rel=noopener>Civil Rights Act</a> of 1964 and the <a href=# rel=noopener>Voting Rights Act</a> of 1965 had brought a renewed sense of hope.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But, though Baldwin’s message would essentially remain the same for the rest of his life, the world changed around him. The assassination of King in 1968 was the death knell of that period’s Civil Rights Movement, and, in the decade that followed, the assassination did not spur any great movement among white Americans to reconsider. Instead, as Carol Anderson has demonstrated in her book <a href=# rel=noopener>White Rage</a>, a political backlash against civil rights had ensued, and politicians like Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan would capitalize on opposition to civil rights victories in order to win elections. Meanwhile, Baldwin was being tracked by the FBI; as his FBI file, which spanned the years 1958-1974, attests, he was under continued surveillance.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The film captures Baldwin’s sentiments during this time with Jackson narrating, “What can I do? Well I’m tired.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Baldwin began work on Remember This House, he had resolved, as he stated in a 1979 <a href=# rel=noopener>speech</a> at Berkeley, to communicate that, despite the legislative achievements of the Civil Rights Movement, blacks remained ruled by slave codes and that his fallen companions were carrying out a “modern day insurrection.” In other words, though the three assassinated men at the center of I Am Not Your Negro had given their lives to their own visions of black liberation, the film comes not from a place of simple celebration of the legacy of Evers, X and King, but from a moment when Baldwin saw, as much as ever, the need to point out to white audiences that the work those men had done had not achieved its aim, and that it was their job — white Americans — to make things better.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>As he once put it</a>, “You always told me ‘It takes time.’ It’s taken my father’s time, my mother’s time, my uncle’s time, my brothers’ and my sisters’ time. How much time do you want for your progress?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite his disillusionment and his view that it was not the responsibility of blacks to fix things, Baldwin continued to use his writing and his voice throughout the 1970s and much of the 1980s as a vehicle for social change — though the world to which he spoke was a new one. On Dec. 10, 1986, almost a year before his death, Baldwin, during a Q&A session after a National Press Club lecture, insisted that the country institute “a white history week; and I’m not joking,” focused on dispelling the illusions that kept the nation in a constant state of peril.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“History is not the past,” stated Baldwin, “It is the present. We carry our history with us. We are our history.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Historians explain how the past informs the present</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Arica L. Coleman is the author of That the Blood Stay Pure: African Americans, Native Americans and the Predicament of Race and Identity in Virginia and chair of the Committee on the Status of African American, Latino/a, Asian American, and Native American (ALANA) Historians and ALANA Histories at the Organization of American Historians.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbmhlg3h%2FjqOYpp2jYq%2BiuMOwoKdllKSwtrnEp6uaqqlitaq%2F06ipsmc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjames-baldwin-documentary-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjames-baldwin-documentary-history.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjames-baldwin-documentary-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjames-baldwin-documentary-history.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjames-baldwin-documentary-history.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjames-baldwin-documentary-history.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lassemblee-approuve-le-plfss-malgre-des-inquietudes-sur-la-politique-familiale.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lassemblee-approuve-le-plfss-malgre-des-inquietudes-sur-la-politique-familiale.html>L'Assemble approuve le PLFSS, malgr des inquitudes sur la politique familiale</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1582827-when-passover-dates-times-how-celebrated.html>When is Passover 2024?
