Destiny has two siblings: a brother and a sister. In an interview in July 2023 with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Football.London,</a> Destiny talks about his family, stating:</p>My mother discovered my passion for football because when I was a baby, I was kicking everything I saw around the house. Obviously after all, my family was behind me. My father pushed me a lot. Everybody, my father, my sister, my mum. All of them.<h2>Destiny Udogie's career</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/6c637968ba0c63e4.jpeg><p class=align-left>Udogie started his football career in the youth system of Hellas Verona and made his Serie A debut in a 2-2 draw against Milan on November 8, 2020. Udogie signed a season-long loan with Udinese, which included a buyout clause, on July 15, 2021. He made 37 appearances<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> for Udinese</a> in his debut season, mainly as a left wingback, and scored five goals.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/ffd9346938461d30.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Aliou Cisse, Senegal's head coach for the World Cup?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Spurs officials confirmed Udogie's signing with a permanent transfer deal that runs through 2027 on August 16, 2022. For the 2022–23 season, Udogie was sent back on loan to Udinese in an unusual arrangement. On August 13, 2023, in the first match of the 2023–24 Premier League season, Udogie made his Tottenham debut as a starter away to Brentford.</p><h3>International career</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/bd3216ca765c321f.jpeg><p class=align-left>Udogie was born in Italy, but his family is from Nigeria. He has also played youth international football for Italy. His debut with the Italy U21 squad on September 3, 2021, was significant in his career. His performance as a starter in a qualifying match was instrumental in a 3-0 win over Luxembourg.</p><h3>Destiny Udogie's contract and transfer</h3><p class=align-left>To secure his place in Tottenham Hotspur's <a href=#>future</a>, the north London club has signed the Italian defender to a long-term contract.

That came this past season (2023–24) after he quickly adapted to the Premier League and excelled as a left-back with the freedom to play inside as Tottenham's number 10 under Postecoglou.</p><p class=align-left>Except for one match missed due to injury and another due to a two-game suspension following a red card and two yellow cards received against Chelsea, he has started every game in the Premier League this season, scoring once and assisting on another.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/625836c99da2adbe.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is Andrew Tate's kickboxing record?

He earns an average <a href=#>salary</a> of $280,000 and ranks among the Premier League's best left-backs.</p><h2>Final word</h2><p class=align-left>Because of his extraordinary skill, Destiny stood out.
