This is a 10-point drop from when last asked in 2013 (84%).</p><p>While the large majority of parents (82%) say that, in principle, they would help their children out in such a way, so too do two thirds of Britons without children (65%), who are answering hypothetically.</p><p>In practice 31% of parents say they have previously arranged some type of work-related opportunity, including one in five (19%) who have organised work experience and 12% who have procured a temporary job for their offspring.</p><h3>What is ‘fair’ when it comes to parents professionally helping their children?</h3><p>There are clear differences in opinion when it comes to the type of opportunity parents are setting up for their child.</p><p>At least half of Britons think it is fair for parents to use their connections to get their children temporary jobs (58%) or some form of professional introductions, be they job interviews (52%), meetings related to jobs or work (54%), or work experience (68%). Between 8-17% view these as unfair, while 18-25% say they are neither fair nor unfair.</p><p>In contrast, just 38% overall think parents arranging a permanent job for their child is reasonable, whilst 28% deem this unfair.</p><p>At least half of 2019 Conservative voters think it is fair to arrange some form of work opportunity. This ranges from a low of 50% who think a permanent job is justifiable to a high of 75% for work experience.</p><p>Labour voters are less likely to think any of the forms of parental assistance we asked about are fair, but particularly in the case of permanent jobs, at 30% – in fact, 36% of Labour voters say this is unfair (compared to only 18% of Tory voters).</p><p>Older Britons (those aged 65 and above) are more receptive to parents helping their children into both temporary posts (67%) and permanent ones (46%) than their younger counterparts are (49% and 23% respectively among 18-24 year olds).</p><h3>Britons say using your contacts to help your children is good parenting, but are less sure about its benefits for the wider society</h3><p>Around half of Britons (50%) consider it good parenting to use personal contacts and help their child obtain a job or work experience, a figure slightly lower than in 2013 (56%). Only 6% consider this bad parenting. Parents are also more likely (55%) than those without children (45%) to view it positively, and a further third in each group (36-37%) say it is neither good nor bad parenting.</p><p>But when it comes to the impacts on wider society of parents using their contacts to help their children into the workplace, only a quarter (26%) think it benefits society (again, down slightly from 32% in 2013). Close to half (47%) think it is neither good nor bad for society, while 18% consider it to be actively harmful.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksqS7zaiksmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhsZGqEdnnIrWSfmZmnerGt0Z6lratdqsCmedOhnKKqXZi8r8DAnKusZZiaubF506GcoqpdmLWquA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f44575-it-fair-parents-use-their-contacts-help-their-chil.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f44575-it-fair-parents-use-their-contacts-help-their-chil.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f44575-it-fair-parents-use-their-contacts-help-their-chil.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f44575-it-fair-parents-use-their-contacts-help-their-chil.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f44575-it-fair-parents-use-their-contacts-help-their-chil.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f44575-it-fair-parents-use-their-contacts-help-their-chil.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1605183-content-creator-john-lafta-pays-grand-visit-gwo-gwo-singer-mike-ejeaghas-home.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1605183-content-creator-john-lafta-pays-grand-visit-gwo-gwo-singer-mike-ejeaghas-home.html>Gwo Gwo Ngwo Singer Mike Ejeagha Cries as Content Creator Visits His Home: &amp;quot;It's Beautiful to Watch&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-much-money-does-karyn-white-make-html.html>How Much Money Does Karyn White Make?
