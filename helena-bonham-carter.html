However, these films are also worth spending a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;evenings watching. The costumes in&nbsp;these movies are not only pleasant to&nbsp;look&nbsp;at, but they often hide a&nbsp;secret meaning.</p><a class=eb077af78f10923627b2 title="16 Actors That Were Brave Enough to Play Unusual Roles and Nailed Them" data-test-id=article-card-link href=#><h3 class="a2cad1d7e851b457f648 b09977b947ef04108b40 bc315c92b3f6942e64b7" data-test-id=article-card-title>16 Actors That Were Brave Enough to Play Unusual Roles and Nailed Them</h3></a><a class=b3eba81ad98ad333369f title="16 Actors That Were Brave Enough to Play Unusual Roles and Nailed Them" data-test-id=article-card-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/336x177/jpg/76d/d88/13772957098085beb8cb455237.jpg></a><p class=e174b611e61cd43b60b8 data-test-id=article-card-description>The ability to&nbsp;completely transform into a&nbsp;character is&nbsp;a&nbsp;coveted skill for an&nbsp;actor. However, many famous actors have certain types of&nbsp;characters that they often portray.

After that, some of&nbsp;the stars of&nbsp;the magic franchise kind of&nbsp;paused their career. For example, we&nbsp;almost haven’t’ seen new movies with James and Oliver Phelps (the Weasley twins), Bonnie Wright (Ginny), and Stanislav Ianevski (Viktor Krum). Other “wizards” try themselves in&nbsp;unusual roles and show&nbsp;us the versatility of&nbsp;their talent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afLWtxqxmoZ2cmruiecGopaGZnWKwor7Tnqlo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhelena-bonham-carter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhelena-bonham-carter.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhelena-bonham-carter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhelena-bonham-carter.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhelena-bonham-carter.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhelena-bonham-carter.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./la-majorite-senatoriale-devoile-sa-proposition-de-loi-pour-corriger-la-reforme-territoriale.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./la-majorite-senatoriale-devoile-sa-proposition-de-loi-pour-corriger-la-reforme-territoriale.html>La majorit snatoriale dvoile sa proposition de loi pour &amp;quot;corriger&amp;quot; la rforme territoriale</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cristiano-ronaldo-proposes-to-his-girlfriend-with-a-dollar787608-diamond-ring.html>Cristiano Ronaldo proposes to his girlfriend with a $787,608 diamond ring</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cristiano-ronaldo-proposes-to-his-girlfriend-with-a-dollar787608-diamond-ring.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
