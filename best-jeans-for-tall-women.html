It’s easier to reach things high up on shelves and can help with basketball skills (supposedly). But there are disadvantages to it as well. For starters, getting comfortable on an airplane is nearly impossible and finding jeans that don’t make you feel like you're back in middle school with your flares embarrassingly high above your sneakers after a turn through the dryer can be a challenge. As someone who hit 5 '9'' fairly young, it’s a trauma that still conjures nightmares full of embarrassment to this day—which is why I often stick to more forgiving ankle-length jeans.</p><p>Finding the perfect fit can be tough for all body types, but at least jeans for short women can be hemmed—an option tall girls don’t have most of the time. That being said, there are plenty of great jeans with a longer length if you know where to look. To find the best jeans for tall women on the market, I spoke to fellow tall women and stylists about their favorites.</p><h2 id=how-to-choose-the-best-jeans-for-tall-women>How to choose the best jeans for tall women</h2><h3>Consider your personal proportions when buying jeans</h3><p>Just because a particular style, like high-rise or low-rise cuts, may be on trend doesn’t mean they’re flattering to everybody. It’s all about the wearer's personal preferences, proportion, and silhouette. Someone with a long waist probably wouldn’t want to cave to the low-rise craze because that would elongate the torso. And “a person who is short-waisted may not want to do a high-rise because it would truncate or shorten the body,” says Hollywood costume designer and stylist Mary Danner. “But you could do more of a mid-rise or a low-rise.”</p><h3>Wide-legged jeans are often flattering</h3><p>While there are no hard and fast rules to jean fit and there are a wide array of body types among tall women, wide-legged jeans often do look great. “A taller frame and stature can hold a wide leg silhouette more proportionally,” says Danner.</p><h3>Think about the style of jeans and shoes you want to wear</h3><p>The variabilities in comparing jeans to shoes are large and differ from person to person, but there are some general rules of thumbs. When going for a cropped look, you want to make sure you’re not showing more than two inches over the ankle “if you don’t want to look like you’re going for high waters,” says Danner.</p><p>Meanwhile, cigarette jeans should hit right around the ankle and, while it all depends on shoes and personal preferences, most other cuts should hit about one inch above the back of the heel.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks>Our top picks:</h2><h3>Best high-waisted jeans for tall women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Everlane The Way-High Jean</a></h3><p>This affordable pair of jeans from Everlane boasts the perfect ‘90s-style fit for women who struggle to find the right length.

A few of my current favorites are Levi’s, Abercrombie & Fitch, Madewell, Not Your Daughters Jeans, Good American, and the others listed above.</p><h3>What are the best jeans for tall, curvy figures?</h3><p>There are a number of brands that are catering to curvy figures these days, like Abercrombie & Fitch, Good American, and Spanx. Again, it depends on the person and their style preferences, but Danner does suggest a flare or wide-leg that drops off the hip for tall, curvy women because “it flatters the curve of the hip and lengthens the leg.”</p><p>But Danner adds, “Whenever I do fittings, we pull so many jeans because jeans are so personal to fit—it’s not one-size-fits-all.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lmpqur7%2BMn6arZaSWua151qiknqZf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-jeans-for-tall-women.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-jeans-for-tall-women.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-jeans-for-tall-women.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-jeans-for-tall-women.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-jeans-for-tall-women.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-jeans-for-tall-women.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./laube-dun-changement-de-modele-le-mouvement-sportif-sinquiete-pour-ses-moyens.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./laube-dun-changement-de-modele-le-mouvement-sportif-sinquiete-pour-ses-moyens.html>A l'aube d'un changement de modle, le mouvement sportif s'inquite pour ses moyens</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-crown-william-kate-middleton-photos-ending.html>Will and Kate Photo From The Crown Hints at the Final Season</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-crown-william-kate-middleton-photos-ending.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
