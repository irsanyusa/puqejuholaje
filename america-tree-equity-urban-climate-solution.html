We will also worsen climate change by dramatically increasing energy use that leads to fossil fuel emissions—at least until we have a carbon-free grid to run those humming air conditioners.&nbsp;Then there is the <a href=#>waste heat that air conditioners emit into cities</a>—they protect those inside while making it hotter and more dangerous outside.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Make no mistake, heat resilient homes and air conditioning must be part of the solution. But we urgently need a complementary form of cooling that can be widely and equitably deployed, and one that doesn’t increase greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;The answer is right in front of us: trees.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A tree can cool the area underneath it by <a href=#>as much as 45 degrees Fahrenheit</a>, and studies have found trees can <a href=#>reduce cooling load in a home by more than 50 percent</a> when placed in the right locations. That saves lives, energy use, and <a href=#>a lot of money</a> for homeowners. The climate math gets even better when you realize that trees in U.S. cities and towns today collectively sequester <a href=#>nearly 130 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year</a>. That’s equivalent to emissions from nearly 30 million passenger vehicles.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This urgently needed potential for carbon negative cooling is why cities across America and around the world are finally investing in urban tree cover, from famously hot cities getting hotter such as <a href=#>Phoenix </a>to famously cool cities that are rapidly heating up, such as <a href=#>Seattle</a> and <a href=#>Boston</a>. Global leaders in this natural cooling movement include <a href=#>Paris</a>, <a href=#>Freetown</a>, and <a href=#>Medellin</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Seeing this movement swelling across America, Democrats in Congress and the Biden administration made a bold decision to include a world-leading <a href=#>$1.5 billion for urban trees in the Inflation Reduction Act</a>, delivered through the U.S. Forest Service’s Urban and Community Forestry Program. While <a href=#>some vocal critics</a> challenged and even lampooned the notion that urban trees could merit such significant investment, the architects of this legislation stayed the course based on their understanding of the huge gains for public health and in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Simply securing this unprecedented commitment to urban trees would alone be cause for hope. But it is important to appreciate how the architects and implementers of this visionary investment, now rolling out across America, have gone three vital steps farther to get our country’s deployment of urban trees right in ways that should inform such efforts around the world.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Laser Focus on Tree Equity</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The new funding is being explicitly focused to address a systemic lack of tree cover in lower income neighborhoods and communities of color that makes these parts of our cities hotter and more polluted. This is imperative when you consider that the additional exposure to heat and air pollution caused by lack of trees is particularly threatening for people who already have greater vulnerabilities such as a home without air conditioning or pre-existing health conditions.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">American Forests’ <a href=#>Tree Equity Score</a> shows why these funds must be focused through an equity lens. This data-driven analysis of every urban neighborhood across America found that lowest income neighborhoods have on average 26 percent less tree cover and are 7 degrees Fahrenheit hotter, while neighborhoods with the highest concentration of people of color—regardless of income—have on average 38 percent less tree cover and are 10 degrees Fahrenheit hotter.&nbsp;You can view the Tree Equity Score data for free online and explore more specific results for your city and neighborhoods.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Supporting Holistic Urban Forestry</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It is also commendable that this new funding is being made available to support urban forestry actions that go beyond planting trees. Planting trees in the neighborhoods that lack them is unquestionably essential to urban tree equity, and the funding will support this work at an unprecedented level along with innovative ways to accelerate planting progress and reduce costs, such as building urban tree nurseries on vacant lots.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But providing healthy, resilient, and sustained tree cover in priority neighborhoods will also require other aspects of urban forestry, such watering and pruning trees, clearing invasive vines, protecting trees via enhanced municipal regulations and incentives, and urban wood programs that turn culled wood into long-lived wood products instead of sending that material to a landfill. It makes all the difference that this new funding can be used to cover these kinds of urban forestry actions.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Turning Trees into Jobs</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The third key element is a commitment to leverage these funds into economic opportunity for those facing the highest barriers. One study led by Key-Log Economics found <a href=#>25.7 direct, indirect and induced jobs for every $1 million invested</a> in urban forestry, which demonstrates the scale of this opportunity. That is why the new funds are being used to support diverse forms of workforce development in the disadvantaged communities where this work will be taking place, building career pathways into employment opportunities with municipal agencies, tree care companies, and non-profits while also catalyzing new small business start-ups.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One leading effort that will be aided by $13 million of the new federal funding, the <a href=#>Detroit Tree Equity Partnership</a>, is showing the way with a 5-year goal to plant 75,000 trees and create 300 jobs. A majority of the new trainees who have joined the Partnership’s workforce program are persons coming out of incarceration, demonstrating the potential of this investment to remove barriers and change lives when targeted the right way.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The fantastic news is that the U.S. Forest Service has already delivered $1.3 billion of this funding to the field though a combination of block grant allocations to states and nationally competitive grants. The biggest mobilization of these funds just occurred in September, when the agency <a href=#>awarded $1 billion of the new funding</a> through 385 grants that will touch all 50 states and engage a diverse cross-section of cities and towns, frontline community organizations, larger non-profits, youth and faith actors, and educational institutions. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This world-leading mobilization of urban trees to save lives and our climate should be a source of hope. Further, because this work will bring the benefits of tree equity to so many people and places across America, it can help foster the broader societal buy-in we need to propel the climate movement to ultimate success.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2NrgnSDjpqknqqZmK5uwNGenGadoaq2tcWMrqmbmZ5isK21zJqrnmWjpLm2wMiopWg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famerica-tree-equity-urban-climate-solution.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2famerica-tree-equity-urban-climate-solution.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2famerica-tree-equity-urban-climate-solution.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2famerica-tree-equity-urban-climate-solution.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famerica-tree-equity-urban-climate-solution.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2famerica-tree-equity-urban-climate-solution.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./olivia-cooke-hated-negroni-spagliato-meme-house-of-the-dragon-1236002965.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./olivia-cooke-hated-negroni-spagliato-meme-house-of-the-dragon-1236002965.html>House of the Dragon Star Olivia Cooke Says I Did Hate Becoming a Meme With Negr</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./10-people-shared-real-life-stories-with-unbelievable-plot-twists-817774.html>10 People Shared Real Life Stories With Unbelievable Plot Twists</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./10-people-shared-real-life-stories-with-unbelievable-plot-twists-817774.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
