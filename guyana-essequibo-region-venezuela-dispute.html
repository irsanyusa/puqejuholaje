On Tuesday, Maduro, who is trying to rename the territory Guayana Esequiba, debuted a new map of Venezuela that included the disputed region.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We want the peaceful rescue of the Guayana Esequiba,” <a href=#>said</a> Maduro, who also demanded that Guyanese companies working in the territory leave within three months. “Our Guayana Esequiba has been de facto occupied by the British Empire and its heirs and they have destroyed the area."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In an <a href=#>address</a> to the nation on Tuesday, Guyanese President Irfaan Ali called the move an “existential threat.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“This is a direct threat to Guyana’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence,” he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the midst of this tension, a helicopter containing Guyanese military officials went missing near the country’s border with Venezuela on Wednesday, sparking a search party and rescue mission. The Guyanese military announced on Friday that it had rescued two survivors and recovered five victims from the crash site.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s everything you need to know.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What happened to the helicopter?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The helicopter—carrying two crew members and five Guyanese military officials—vanished during an inspection of troops guarding a contested border that Venezuela claims as its territory. Authorities said dire weather conditions likely contributed to the disappearance, rather than hostile fire from Venezuela.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Guyana Defence Force lost contact with the Bell 412 EPI aircraft after it departed from a fuel stop in western Guyana, Army Chief Brigadier General Omar Khan said, according to the <a href=#>Associated Press</a>. The aircraft was flying over mountainous areas about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Guyana’s border with Venezuela when contact was lost after the aircraft <a href=#>sent an Emergency Locator Transmitter signal</a> at 11.20 a.m., local time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Khan stated there was no sign of foul play when search efforts for the aircraft were still ongoing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We do not have any information suggesting that there was any flight by Venezuelan aircraft in that area,” Khan said. “Speculation is not what I want to go into. Our priority is to save the lives of our officers and ranks.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The crash site was located within 24 hours. The Guyana Defence Force (GDF) said on Thursday at 11 a.m. that the crash site had been “positively identified” and the aircraft was also spotted. “Search and rescue teams have also reported positive signs of life on the scene,” the GDF <a href=#>said in a statement.</a> “Troops are being rappelled to the exact site location.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Thursday, the GDF <a href=#>issued a press release </a>that five people on board—Brigadier (Retd) Gary Beaton, Colonel Michael Shahoud, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Charles, Lieutenant Colonel Sean Welcome, and Staff Sergeant Jason Khan—had died. There were two survivors: Lieutenant Andio Crawford and Corporal Dwayne Jackson.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The GDF <a href=#>posted on its Facebook page</a> that the search and rescue operation evacuated survivors and victims from the crash site in the mountains of the Mazaruni Area on Friday. The two survivors arrived at 3:55 p.m. local time at Eugene F. Correia Airport after a medical check, and the bodies of the five crash victims arrived at 5:30 p.m.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Why is the Essequibo territory disputed?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Venezuela has long sought to control Essequibo. Disputes stretch back to 1841, when the Venezuelan government alleged that, in its acquisition of British Guiana (now Guyana) from the Netherlands, the British had encroached on Venezuelan territory. In 1899, the border was decided by an international Tribunal of Arbitration and the region has remained under control of British Guiana and now Guyana for over a century.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2015, the discovery of oil off of Essequibo’s coast revived the territory dispute over the 160,000 square km (61,776 square miles) region. The region holds strong economic prospects. Guyana’s fast-growing economy is largely driven by gas and oil. For Venezuela, which has faced hyperinflation, international sanctions, and economic crises in recent years, a revival of the country’s oil industry—coupled with a recent ease in U.S. sanctions—could help stabilize the economy.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What happens next?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Venezuela’s decision will likely be met with strong international resistance. The case is currently before the United Nation’s top court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), though a formal ruling on the disagreement could take years. Last week, the IJC banned Venezuela from taking any action in the region, though Maduro has said the court does not have authority to rule on the dispute.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ahead of Sunday’s referendum, Brazil’s top foreign policy advisor Celso Amorim urged Venezuela to avoid the use of force or threat over the border region. "Now there are new facts that are still more worrisome. We'll not fail to transmit our concerns especially in relation to the policy of no use of force," Amorim told Reuters.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Thursday, the U.S. conducted military drills in Guyana. "In collaboration with the Guyana Defense Force, the U.S. Southern Command will conduct flight operations within Guyana on December 7," the U.S. Embassy in Guyana <a href=#>said in a statement</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The embassy noted that the flight exercise "builds upon routine engagement and operations to enhance security partnership" between the U.S. and Guyana, and is meant to "strengthen regional cooperation."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">President Ali told <a href=#>CBS</a> in a Dec. 5 interview that he has reached out to leaders across the globe— including the U.S., India, and Cuba. “Our first line of defense is diplomacy,” he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In his address, President Ali assured investors that they had nothing to fear, and said he has already spoken to U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, and that the matter would be reported to the ICJ and U.N. Security Council.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The Guyana Defense Force is on high alert,” he said. “Venezuela has clearly declared itself an outlaw nation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2RognWFjqCsspmelnqmv9KeqK6hkqR6s7HGoqanZaaau6bG1J6jmmWUnsCxwdOeZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fguyana-essequibo-region-venezuela-dispute.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fguyana-essequibo-region-venezuela-dispute.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fguyana-essequibo-region-venezuela-dispute.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fguyana-essequibo-region-venezuela-dispute.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fguyana-essequibo-region-venezuela-dispute.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fguyana-essequibo-region-venezuela-dispute.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-crown-william-kate-middleton-photos-ending.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-crown-william-kate-middleton-photos-ending.html>Will and Kate Photo From The Crown Hints at the Final Season</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./verve-promotes-liz-parker-partner-1235504972.html>Verve Promotes Liz Parker to Partner (EXCLUSIVE)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./verve-promotes-liz-parker-partner-1235504972.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
